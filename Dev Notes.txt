Dev Notes

10/19/23 - Hours Worked: 1
Current State of Photogizer:
Reads a hardcoded image file, detects metadata, and prints it if it exists.

Discovered copied photos get their "created date" replaced.
Learned to access metadata with Python Pillow.
Learned that some services, including discord, erase metadata. Gmail does not.

Photogizer first goal:
Print most accurate "created date" info available from a hardcoded image. Use metadata if possible, else, use the system's created date. 
Second goal: 
Detect photos in a directory given by input. 
Third goal:
Combine first two steps, to create a program that reads a directory (given by user input) and prints the most accurate possible created date for each image in the directory. 
Go from there.
